## Features

### URL Filter 🌐

**Activation (default: true)**: `GUARDIAN_URL_FILTER: true|false`  
**Help Command**: `!gd url`

Guardian supports URL filtering based on a customizable domain list.

**Examples**:
- `!gd block t.me`
- `!gd unblock t.me`

### URL Phishing Check 🗡

Guardian supports checking URLs in messages for suspicious content.  
The analysis can be powered by the following providers:

#### VirusTotal

**Reference**: https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/url-info  
**API-Key (required)**: `GUARDIAN_VIRUS_TOTAL_KEY: <key>`  
**Activation (default: false)**: `GUARDIAN_URL_CHECK_VIRUS_TOTAL: true|false`

VirusTotal allows scanning a full URL and returning a very comprehensive scan report.  
Guardian rates a URL "suspicious" if the statistics `malicious` and `suspicious` have a combined score of 3 or more.

#### FishFish

**Reference**: https://fishfish.gg  
**Activation (default: false)**: `GUARDIAN_URL_CHECK_FISHFISH: true|false`

FishFish allows scanning a domain and returning a rating, if found in their reports.  
Guardian rates a URL "suspicious" if the FishFish rating is `malware` or `phishing` rather than `safe`.
